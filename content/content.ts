The knob and the hand fight over one value, so the knob sets a base and your hand modulates around it. Wrist roll also turns knobs, so tilt re-arms only after passing back through neutral; whichever interaction consumes the signal owns it. And a hand hanging at rest sits exactly where the sign flips, so past 150° reads as a resting posture, not a playing one.",

I'd smoothed the tilt with a rolling average, which is standard practice, but the gesture loop skips frames when a hand holds still, so a held 60° tilt settled at 0.216 instead of 0.770.

It documents an attempt at understanding the geometric method of drawing a lute in perspective. Through the reenactment of the historical techniques, the artist seeks to deliberately look back and deeply analyze what we can learn from the past rather than looking to the future, in an era that is ever accelerating towards an unknowable technological future.",
      "The film is constructed to faithfully emulate Durer. The costumes and the apparatus were hand crafted by the artist and the final drawing is also made from scratch. The film as the final product emphasizes the importance of the process. It is remembering through the act of doing. By placing the modern student in the archaic setting, it questions what we lost, what we can learn, and what is useful to us from something that many would call obsolete. What are the benefits of understanding the antiquated? What knowledge have we lost in the pursuit of new knowledge?",

For this artwork, the process and the artistic practice is the object of commemoration.
